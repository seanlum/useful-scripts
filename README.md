## Binary Converter (binary-converter.html)
A collection of tools I wrote while studying for some computer networking tests. These tools allow you to work with IPv4 network IDs, CIDR notation, subnets, and more. It also has tools for converting base-10 numbers to two's-compliment (binary) numbers, and back again.
